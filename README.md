#### 12/22
* 9:00 figuring out how to run client and api in the same project
* 11:00 use concurrently
* 12-4 learning Material UI https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xoz31I1FuiY&t=1442s
Have a mental break down when using material UI deletes everything in the browser but there are no compiling errors. Finally figure out that I installed Material UI in the client but all it's dependencies in the api. So it was compiling because they existed, but nothing worked because the client could not access them...
