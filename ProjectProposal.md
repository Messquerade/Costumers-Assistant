# Costume Design Tool

Project will allow users to plan and design theatrical costume productions; including time management, budgeting, visuals, and centralizing information.

## Minimum Features:
* Full CRUD for all elements of a production: scenes, actors, costumes, articles of costume
Visualization of data, such as graphs of completed costumes or articles, average cost per costume, budget remaining warnings
* Calendar to track important dates: fittings, dress rehearsals, production meetings, shows

## Technologies:
* React
* JavaScript
* Redux
* Firebase database (or MongoDB)
* Chart.js
* CSS and BootStrap
* HTML

## Stretch Goals:
* User Authentication and Admin roles
* Reminders sent to user emails for important dates or just displayed on the user's homepage
* Email preferences settings
* Ability to make a production private or public or shareable with teammates
* Social messaging or notice board for users to post about specific costume needs (ie looking for 1860s gown, size 8 for September-November)

## Additional Technologies for Stretch Goals:
* Hooks
* React router
* Tokens

## Notes:
I will focus on the design and visual aspects of the MVP first. I would like to make the application as user friendly and intuitive as possible for a broad user base. I definitely want to host the website and authentication is high on the priority list.
